RC Car Controller based on Arduino
----------------------------------

Feature support:
----------------
	- a gyro sensor to detect / correct z-axis rotation for drift stabilisation
	- an acc sensor to detect forward/backward (LED control, x-axis) and check traction (y-axis)
	- hott or ppm connection from rx
	- telemetry to rx (hott)
	- RGB LED (ws2812b), color and intensity (Rear, break, back lights)
	- switches for power LED
	- 2 servo outputs for steering , camera
	- 1 PWM output for ESC
	- switching outputs for horn, power led, etc.
	- battery monitor for telemetry
	- compass and GPS for telemetry
	- model based speed detection (?)
